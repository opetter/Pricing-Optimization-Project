# Pricing-Optimization-Project - Excel
Pricing optimization simulation to which provides insight into possible outcomes for different sale and pricing scenarios in order to help optimize operations. Here is the complete outlined problem and scenario: 
Jack runs a subscription cookie business where customers pay a monthly subscription and
receive deliveries every month. Around holidays they also run a special for an additional box, which
many customers then give out as a gift to friends or family. Easter is coming up, and Jack is planning a
promotion for the Easter cookies special box.
The regular price of the box is $49, and it costs Jack $20 to make and ship. It has been available
to order for a couple of weeks now, and the order deadline is coming up in 7 days. Jack is planning to
put the box on sale for $38 to boost sales. For past holiday specials, the sale has usually started 7 days
before the order deadline and has resulted in brisk sales.
As Jack’s friend and armchair analyst, you wonder if the timing of the sale is optimal. You
suspect that many of the customers who are buying the box on sale would have bought it anyway at full
price, if the sale had just started later (or even not at all). You ask Jack if they have any sales data that
could help you evaluate this decision.
Jack has noticed that they have a ‘pool’ of potential customers that tend to order these special
boxes. On any given day, about 10% of the remaining pool of customers will order the box if it is regular
price, or 20% if it is on sale. Assume the number of customers who place the order is Normally
distributed, with standard deviations of 3% and 5% respectively. Jack thinks there are about 500
customers in the pool this time, 7 days before the order deadline. (Ex. Suppose 12% order today. That is
60 customers, leaving 440 in the pool. On the next day, suppose only 5% of the pool orders. That is
440*5% = 22 customers, leaving 418 in the pool now. And so on..)
